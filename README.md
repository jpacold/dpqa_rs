# Rust DPQA compiler

This is a Rust version of a compiler for a 2D dynamically field-programmable qubit array (DPQA), described by [Tan et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03487). The Python version of the compiler referenced in the paper can be found at [UCLA-VAST/DPQA](https://github.com/UCLA-VAST/DPQA).
